Birdcoop is a distributed Twitter crawler

It is composed of two distinct types of components: master, and workers. A master can be started on any publicly reachable machine, and workers are lightweight apps that run on any machine able to reach the master.

Some other features include:
* Master redundancy
* Data backup/replication
* Report generation from crawled data
* Crawls up to 15000 users per worker per hour

Dependencies:
* Python 2.6 (or simplejson)

To run:
* Master
 * cd master
 * python server.py <id of user to start from>
* Worker
 * cd worker
 * python worker.py <hostname of master>
